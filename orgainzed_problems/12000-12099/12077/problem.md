## 문제

Googlers are very interested in cubes, but they are bored with normal three-dimensional cubes and also want to think about other kinds of cubes! A "D-dimensional cube" has D dimensions, all of equal length. (D may be any positive integer; for example, a 1-dimensional cube is a line segment, and a 2-dimensional cube is a square, and a 4-dimensional cube is a hypercube.) A "D-dimensional cuboid" has D dimensions, but they might not all have the same lengths.

Suppose we have an **N**-dimensional cuboid. The **N** dimensions are numbered in order (0, 1, 2, ..., N - 1), and each dimension has a certain length. We want to solve many subproblems of this type:

1. Take all consecutive dimensions between the **Li**-th dimension and **Ri**-th dimension, inclusive.
2. Use those dimensions to form a D-dimensional cuboid, where D = **Ri** - **Li** + 1. (For example, if **Li** = 3 and **Ri** = 6, we would form a 4-dimensional cuboid using the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th dimensions of our **N**-dimensional cuboid.)
3. Reshape it into a D-dimensional cube **that has exactly the same volume as that D-dimensional cuboid**, and find the edge length of that cube.

Each test case will have **M** subproblems like this, all of which use the same original **N**-dimensional cuboid.

## 입력

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow.

Each test case begins with two integers **N** and **M**; **N** is the number of dimensions and **M** is the number of queries. Then there is one line with **N** positive integers **ai**, which are the lengths of the dimensions, in order. Then, **M** lines follow. In the ith line, there are two integers **Li** and **Ri**, which give the range of dimensions to use for the ith subproblem.

## 출력

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x:", where x is the test case number (starting from 1). After that, output **M** lines, where the ith line has the edge length for the ith subproblem. An edge length will be considered correct if it is within an absolute error of 10-6 of the correct answer.
