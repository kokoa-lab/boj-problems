## 문제

N-beat is a popular rhythm arcade game, in which you push buttons arranged in a $x \times y$ grid. The buttons light up when you have to push them; you have to push them with precise timing to get scores.

One game of N-beat consists of one or more screens. A **screen** is a configuration of lit buttons which you have to push.

![](./001_preview)

For example, the picture above shows $4$ successive **screen**s for a N-beat machine with $4 \times 4$ grid. Here, boxes with the target mark are the lit buttons you have to press.

A sequence of screens in a game is called a **transcription**.

Now, Jaeha Koo, a genius composer, just made a new song for N-beat. You’re going to make transcription for this song.

There are $B$ beats in this song, so this transcription will consist of $B$ **screen**s. Therefore, without any restriction, there are a total of $(2^{xy})^B$ possible transcriptions.

But **transcription**s differ in difficulty. Generally, you can push one button with one finger, so it’s harder when a single screen has more lit buttons. Especially, if a screen has more than $10$ lit buttons, it’s very difficult to push them successfully. Also, adjacent screens having a lot of lit buttons can also can make the game difficult. For example, two successive screens with $7$ and $6$ lit buttons each might be more difficult than two screens with $2$ and $8$ lit buttons each.

As a generous transcriptor, you decided to limit the number of lit buttons. The limit is given as three nonnegative integers: $p\_1$, $p\_2$, and $p\_3$. $p\_1$ is the maximum number of lit buttons you can have in any one screen. $p\_2$ is the maximum number of lit buttons you can have in any two consecutive screens. Also, as you guessed, $p\_3$ is the maximum number of lit buttons you can have in any three consecutive screens. In the picture above, $4$ screens each have $4$, $8$, $6$, $8$ of turned-on buttons, so this transcription will only be valid if $p\_1 ≥ 8$, $p\_2 ≥ 14$, and $p\_3 ≥ 22$.

Your task is to calculate the number of possible transcriptions given $x$, $y$, $B$, $p\_1$, $p\_2$ and $p\_3$. As the result can be quite huge, just calculate the answer mod $10^9 + 7$.

## 입력

The input consists of $T$ test cases. The first line of the input contains $T$.

Each test case starts with $6$ integers $x$, $y$ ($1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000$), $B$ ($1 ≤ B ≤ 10^9$), $p\_1$ ($0 ≤ p\_1 ≤ 10$), $p\_2$ ($0 ≤ p\_2 ≤ 20$), $p\_3$ ($0 ≤ p\_3 ≤ 30$) separated by a whitespace.

## 출력

For each test case, print the number of possible transcriptions mod $10^9 + 7$, in a single line.
