## 문제

VAT (value-added tax) is a tax imposed at a certain rate proportional to the sale price.

Our store uses the following rules to calculate the after-tax prices.

* When the VAT rate is *x*%, for an item with the before-tax price of *p* yen, its after-tax price of the item is *p* (100+*x*) / 100 yen, fractions rounded off.
* The total after-tax price of multiple items paid at once is the sum of after-tax prices of the items.

The VAT rate is changed quite often. Our accountant has become aware that "different pairs of items that had the same total after-tax price may have different total after-tax prices after VAT rate changes." For example, when the VAT rate rises from 5% to 8%, a pair of items that had the total after-tax prices of 105 yen before can now have after-tax prices either of 107, 108, or 109 yen, as shown in the table below.

| Before-tax prices of two items | After-tax price with 5% VAT | After-tax price with 8% VAT |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20, 80 | 21 + 84 = 105 | 21 + 86 = 107 |
| 2, 99 | 2 + 103 = 105 | 2 + 106 = 108 |
| 13, 88 | 13 + 92 = 105 | 14 + 95 = 109 |

Our accountant is examining effects of VAT-rate changes on after-tax prices. You are asked to write a program that calculates the possible maximum total after-tax price of two items with the new VAT rate, knowing their total after-tax price before the VAT rate change.

## 입력

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is in one line, which consists of three integers *x*, *y*, and *s* separated by a space. *x* is the VAT rate in percent *before* the VAT-rate change, *y* is the VAT rate in percent *after* the VAT-rate change, and *s* is the sum of after-tax prices of two items *before* the VAT-rate change. For these integers, 0 < *x* < 100, 0 < *y* < 100, 10 < *s* < 1000, and *x* ≠ *y* hold. For before-tax prices of items, all possibilities of 1 yen through *s*-1 yen should be considered.

The end of the input is specified by three zeros separated by a space.

## 출력

For each dataset, output in a line the possible maximum total after-tax price when the VAT rate is changed to *y*%.

## 힌트

In the following table, an instance of a before-tax price pair that has the maximum after-tax price after the VAT-rate change is given for each dataset of the sample input.

| Dataset | Before-tax prices | After-tax price with *y*% VAT |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 8 105 | 13, 88 | 14 + 95 = 109 |
| 8 5 105 | 12, 87 | 12 + 91 = 103 |
| 1 2 24 | 1, 23 | 1 + 23 = 24 |
| 99 98 24 | 1, 12 | 1 + 23 = 24 |
| 12 13 26 | 1, 23 | 1 + 25 = 26 |
| 1 22 23 | 1, 22 | 1 + 26 = 27 |
| 1 13 201 | 1,199 | 1 +224 = 225 |
| 13 16 112 | 25, 75 | 29 + 87 = 116 |
| 2 24 50 | 25, 25 | 31 + 31 = 62 |
| 1 82 61 | 11, 50 | 20 + 91 = 111 |
| 1 84 125 | 50, 75 | 92 +138 = 230 |
| 1 99 999 | 92,899 | 183+1789 =1972 |
| 99 1 999 | 1,502 | 1 +507 = 508 |
| 98 99 999 | 5,500 | 9 +995 =1004 |
| 1 99 11 | 1, 10 | 1 + 19 = 20 |
| 99 1 12 | 1, 6 | 1 + 6 = 7 |
