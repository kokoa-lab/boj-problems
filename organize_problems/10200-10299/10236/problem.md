## 문제

A programmer developed a new encryption system. However, his system has an issue that two or more distinct strings are 'encrypted' to the same string.

We have a string encrypted by his system. To decode the original string, we want to enumerate all the candidates of the string before the encryption. Your mission is to write a program for this task.

The encryption is performed taking the following steps. Given a string that consists only of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z').

1. Change the first 'b' to 'a'. If there is no 'b', do nothing.
2. Change the first 'c' to 'b'. If there is no 'c', do nothing.
3. ...
4. Change the first 'z' to 'y'. If there is no 'z', do nothing.

## 입력

The input consists of at most 100 datasets. Each dataset is a line containing an encrypted string. The encrypted string consists only of lowercase letters, and contains at least 1 and at most 20 characters.

The input ends with a line with a single '#' symbol.

## 출력

For each dataset, the number of candidates *n* of the string before encryption should be printed in a line first, followed by lines each containing a candidate of the string before encryption. If *n* does not exceed 10, print all candidates in dictionary order; otherwise, print the first five and the last five candidates in dictionary order.

Here, dictionary order is recursively defined as follows. The empty string comes the first in dictionary order. For two nonempty strings *x* = *x*1 ... *x*k and *y* = *y*1 ... *y*l, the string *x* precedes the string *y* in dictionary order if

* *x*1 precedes *y*1 in alphabetical order ('a' to 'z'), or
* *x*1 and *y*1 are the same character and *x*2 ... *x*k precedes *y*2 ... *y*l in dictionary order.
