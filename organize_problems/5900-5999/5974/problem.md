## 문제

Bessie has a lovely charm bracelet whose length is L (4 <= L <= 32,768) mm.  Hanging from this bracelet are C (1 <= C <= 512) charms, each at a unique integer distance from the bracelet's left side. Charm i dangles on the end of a string whose length is S\_i mm (1 <= S\_i <= 25) and which is located P\_i (0 <= P\_i <= L) mm from the bracelet's left side.

Margaret snatches the bracelet from Bessie and nails it (with a zero-width nail) to a fencepost. The nail is located N mm (1 <= N <= L-1) from the left side of the bracelet, and the bracelet itself thus hangs left and right of the nail, with gravity pulling the bracelet and charms straight down.

Bessie is curious: How far is each charm from the nail in the fencepost?

By way of example, consider a bracelet of length 16 mm with three charms. The schematic diagram below shows + signs which are each separated by 1 mm and vertical bars which each represent 1mm of an attached string. The charms are defined to be 4, 7, and 3 mm from  
the bracelet.

```

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |         |             |
            |         |             |
            |         |             *
            *         |
                      |
                      |
                      *
```

When the bracelet is nailed to the fencepost with the nail at location 5, it droops like this (please ignore the left-right spread which is shown for clarity):

```

Droop  Bracelet         Bracelet

  0      5         +        5    <---- nail is here

  2      3      | + +       7
  3      2      | + +       8              D

  8                 + |    13              |
  9                 + |    14              V
 10                 + |    15
 11                 + *    16
 12                     |
 13                     |
 14                     *
```

As you can see, the first charm droops down 5 mm from the nail; the second charm droops to 11 mm and the third charm all the way down to 14 mm from the nail.

Calculate the charm droop distance for each charm given.

## 입력

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: L, C, and N
* Lines 2..C+1: Line i+1 describes charm i with two space-separated integers: S\_i and P\_i

## 출력

* Lines 1..C: Line i contains the distance from charm i to the nail
