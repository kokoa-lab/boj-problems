## 문제

One of the SWERC judges has a dog named Boy. Besides being a good competitive programmer, Boy loves fresh air, so she wants to be walked at least twice a day. Walking Boy requires $120$ **consecutive** minutes. Two walks cannot overlap, but one can start as soon as the previous one has finished.

Boy before and after getting ACCEPTED on this problem.

Today, the judge sent $n$ messages to the SWERC Discord server. The $i$-th message was sent $a\_i$ minutes after midnight. You know that, when walking Boy, the judge does not send any messages, but he can send a message right before or right after a walk. Is it possible that the judge walked Boy at least twice today?

Note that a day has $1440$ minutes, and a walk is considered to happen *today* if it starts at a minute $s ≥ 0$ and ends right before a minute $e ≤ 1440$. In that case, it must hold that $e - s = 120$ and, for every $i = 1, 2, \dots , n$, either $a\_i ≤ $s or $a\_i ≥ e$.

## 입력

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 100$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $t$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 100$) — the number of messages sent by the judge.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a1\_, a\_2, \dots , a\_n$ ($0 ≤ a\_1 < a\_2 < \cdots < a\_n < 1440$) — the times at which the messages have been sent (in minutes elapsed from midnight).

## 출력

For each test case, output one line containing `YES` if it is possible that Boy has been walked at least twice, and `NO` otherwise.

## 힌트

In the **first test case**, the judge has sent a message at each time multiple of $100$ (excluding $0$). It is impossible that he has walked Boy even once.

In the second test case, the times are the same as above, but $500$ and $1000$ are missing. The judge could have walked Boy, for instance, during the time intervals $[440, 560]$ and $[980, 1100]$. The situation is illustrated in the picture below, where the walks are represented by green intervals.

In the **third test case**, the times are the same as in the first test case, but $1000$ is missing. The judge could have walked Boy at most once.

In the **fourth test case**, Boy could have been walked during the time intervals $[739, 859]$ and $[859, 979]$.
