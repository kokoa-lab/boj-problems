## 문제

You found an antique box in your warehouse and decided to open it. The moment you open the box, it traps you into a cursed game where you are playing against a demon. The game consists of $333$ rounds and you have to win all rounds in order to escape. The demon also gives you $999$ coins that you can use throughout all rounds.

Note that in this problem, denote cell $(r, c)$ of a grid as the cell in row $r$ and column $c$ of the grid.

Before the start of each round, the demon will prepare a *secret paper*, which can be represented as a grid with $3$ rows and $3$ columns, both numbered from $1$ to $3$. The demon will secretly put a hole in **one or more cells**, and you are not aware which cells have a hole in it. Then, the round starts with the demon giving you an **odd** integer $N$ ($3 ≤ N ≤ 33$).

Within each round, you can ask the demon several queries, each costing you one coin. For each query, you are allowed to give the demon *your paper*, which can be represented as a grid with $N$ rows and $N$ columns, both numbered from $1$ to $N$. Each cell is coloured either black or white by you.

For each of your query, the demon will calculate a binary *result grid* with $N - 2$ rows and $N - 2$ columns, both numbered from $1$ to $N - 2$. The value on cell $(r, c)$ of the result grid is filled as follows.

* The demon will put the secret paper on top of your paper such that the cell $(r + i - 1, c + j - 1)$ of your paper aligns with the cell $(i, j)$ of the secret paper, for $1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3$.
* The demon can only see the colour of the cell in your paper if the corresponding cell in the secret paper has a hole in it.
* The value on cell $(r, c)$ of the result grid is $1$ if there is an odd number of black cells that it can see through the holes, or $0$ otherwise.

You win the round if the result grid consists of only the values $1$. Otherwise, the demon will give you the result grid as a feedback, and the round continues.

If you have spent all the coins and still did not win all the rounds, then you will be trapped forever. Escape the cursed game!
