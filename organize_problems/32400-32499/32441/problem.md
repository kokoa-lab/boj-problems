## 문제

In the land of Oz, roads are paved with colored stones. Each road connects exactly two cities, can be traveled in both directions, and is colored with stones of a single color.

Dorothy is visiting Oz for the first time and wants to take a tour of the country, meeting the following conditions:

* The tour must start and end in the same city.
* The tour must pass through each road in the country exactly once and cannot use two consecutive roads (i.e., one immediately after the other) that have the same color.
* The first and last roads of the tour must have different colors.

Figure (a) below illustrates an example with five cities and six roads. Figure (b) shows a possible tour that starts and ends in city $2$ and satisfies the road color restrictions. In figure (b), the tour starts in city $2$ and goes, in sequence, through roads $1$ (red), $3$ (green), $4$ (blue), $2$ (red), $6$ (blue) and, finally, $5$ (green).

Help Dorothy find such a tour or, if it is not possible, indicate that it does not exist.

## 입력

The first line of the input contains three integers, $N$, $M$, and $K$, representing the number of cities ($2 ≤ N ≤ 1000$), the number of roads ($1 ≤ M ≤ 1000$), and the number of colors ($1 ≤ K ≤ 1000$), respectively. Cities are identified by integers from $1$ to $N$, roads are identified by integers from $1$ to $M$, and colors are identified by integers from $1$ to $K$. Each of the following $M$ lines describes a road and contains three integers $I$, $J$, and $C$, where $I$ and $J$ represent cities ($1 ≤ I, J ≤ N$, and $I \ne J$), and $C$ indicates the color of road $1 ≤ C ≤ K$. The roads are given in the order of their identification, that is, the first road in the input is number $1$, the second road is number $2$, and so on.

## 출력

If there is no tour that satisfies the constraints, print a single integer `-1`. Otherwise, your program should output two lines describing a valid tour. The first line should contain the identifier of the starting city of the tour. The second line should contain $M$ distinct integers, each identifying a road, in tour order. If there is more than one possible tour, print any one of them.
