## 문제

Car trialling requires the following of carefully worded instructions. When setting a trial, the organiser places traps in the instructions to catch out the unwary.

Write a program to determine whether an instruction obeys the following rules, which are loosely based on real car trialling instructions. **BOLD-TEXT** indicates text as it appears in the instruction (case sensitive), | separates options of which exactly one must be chosen, and .. expands, so **A**..**D** is equivalent to **A**|**B**|**C**|**D**.

```

instruction = navigational  |  time-keeping  |  navigational b time-keeping
navigational = directional  |  navigational AND THEN directional
directional = how direction  |  how direction where
how = GO  |  GO when  |  KEEP
direction = RIGHT  |  LEFT
when = FIRST  |  SECOND  |  THIRD
where = AT sign
sign = "signwords"
signwords = s-word  |  signwords s-word
s-word = letter  |  s-word letter
letter = A..Z  |  .
time-keeping = record  |  change
record = RECORD TIME
change = cas TO nnn KMH
cas = CHANGE AVERAGE SPEED  |  CAS
nnn = digit  |  nnn digit
digit = 0..9
```

Note that s-word and nnn are sequences of letters and digits respectively, with no intervening spaces. There will be one or more spaces between items except before a period (.), after the opening speech marks or before the closing speech marks.

## 입력

Each input line will consist of not more than 75 characters. The input will be terminated by a line consisting of a single #.

## 출력

The output will consist of a series of sequentially numbered lines, either containing the valid instruction, or the text `Trap!` if the line did not obey the rules. The line number will be right justified in a field of 3 characters, followed by a full-stop, a single space, and the instruction, with sequences of more than one space reduced to single spaces.
