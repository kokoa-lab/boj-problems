## 문제

You have been asked to take a small icon that appears on the screen of a smart telephone and scale it up so it looks bigger on a regular computer screen.

The icon will be encoded as characters (x and \*) in a 3 × 3 grid as follows:

```

*x*
 xx 
* *
```

Write a program that accepts a positive integer scaling factor and outputs the scaled icon. A scaling factor of k means that each character is replaced by a k × k grid consisting only of that character.

## 입력

The input will be a positive integer k such that k < 25.

## 출력

The output will be 3k lines, which represent each individual line scaled by a factor of k and repeated k times. A line is scaled by a factor of k by replacing each character in the line with k copies of the character.
