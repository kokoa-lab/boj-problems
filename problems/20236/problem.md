## 문제

Let us define "Compare-and-Set" operation for a global variable $v$. The operation checks if the variable is equal to $a$. If that's true, the variable value changes to $b$ and the operation succeeds. Otherwise, the variable doesn't change and the operation fails. Let us denote the operation as $\operatorname{CAS}(a,b)$.

Imagine that you are given a list of such operations $\operatorname{CAS}(a\_1,b\_1), \dots, \operatorname{CAS}(a\_n,b\_n)$. Also, you are given an initial value for the variable, $c$, and a list of wishes $w\_1, \dots w\_n$, where $w\_i$ tells whether the operation $\operatorname{CAS}(a\_i,b\_i)$ should be successful. Your task is to determine the order of operations execution so that all the wishes are satisfied.

## 입력

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $c$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$; $1 \le c \le 10^9$) --- the number of operations and the initial value of the variable.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $a\_i, b\_i, w\_i$ ($1 \le a\_i, b\_i \le 10^9$; $0 \le w\_i \le 1$), denoting $\operatorname{CAS}(a\_i, b\_i)$ operation that you wish to be successful if $w\_i = 1$ and unsuccessful if $w\_i = 0$. The operations are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in order of input.

## 출력

If no correct order of operations exists, output a single word "`No`".

Otherwise, output a word "`Yes`" followed by $n$ distinct integers $p\_1, p\_2, \ldots p\_n$ ($1 \le p\_i \le n$), meaning that operation $p\_1$ should be executed first, then operation $p\_2$, and so on. If there are several possible orders, output any of them.
