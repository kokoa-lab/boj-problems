## 문제

Anna has a row of **N** blocks, each with exactly one letter from `A` to `Z` written on it. The blocks are numbered 1, 2, ..., **N** from left to right.

Today, she is learning about palindromes. A palindrome is a string that is the same written forwards and backwards. For example, `ANNA`, `RACECAR`, `AAA` and `X` are all palindromes, while `AB`, `FROG` and `YOYO` are not.

Bob wants to test how well Anna understands palindromes, and will ask her **Q** questions. The i-th question is: can Anna use all of the blocks numbered from **Li** to **Ri**, inclusive, rearranging them if necessary, to form a palindrome? After each question, Anna puts the blocks back in their original positions.

Please help Anna by finding out how many of Bob's questions she can answer "yes" to.

## 입력

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing the two integers **N** and **Q**, the number of blocks and the number of questions, respectively. Then, another line follows, containing a string of **N** uppercase characters (`A` to `Z`). Then, **Q** lines follow. The i-th line contains the two integers **Li** to **Ri**, describing the i-th question.

## 출력

For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the number of questions Anna can answer "yes" to.

## 힌트

In Sample Case #1, **N** = 7 and **Q** = 5.

* For the first question, Anna must use the blocks `AACC`. She can rearrange these blocks into the palindrome `ACCA` (or `CAAC`).
* For the second question, Anna must use the blocks `A`. This is already a palindrome, so she does not need to rearrange them.
* For the third question, Anna must use the blocks `BAAC`. These blocks cannot be rearranged into a palindrome.
* For the fourth question, Anna must use the blocks `CA`. These blocks cannot be rearranged into a palindrome.
* For the fifth question, Anna must use the blocks `AACCA`. She can rearrange these blocks to form the palindrome `ACACA` (or `CAAAC`).

In total, she is able to answer "yes" to 3 of Bob's questions, so the answer is 3.

In Sample Case #2, **N** = 3 and **Q** = 5. For the first question, Anna must use the blocks `XYZ` to create a palindrome. This is impossible, and since the rest of Bob's questions are the same as the first one, the answer is 0.
