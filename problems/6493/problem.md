## 문제

Recognizing strings based on a set of restrictions is a common computational problem. A Slurpy is a string of characters that has certain properties. Your program will read in strings of characters and output whether or not they are Slurpys.

A Slump is a character string that has the following properties:

1. Its first character is either a 'D' or an 'E'.
2. The first character is followed by a string of one or more 'F's.
3. The string of one or more 'F's is followed by either a Slump or a 'G'. The Slump or 'G' that follows the F's ends the Slump. For example DFFEFFFG is a Slump since it has a 'D' for its first character, followed by a string of two F's, and ended by the Slump 'EFFFG'.
4. Nothing else is a Slump.

A Slimp is a character string that has the following properties:

A Slimp is a character string that has the following properties:

1. Its first character is an 'A'.
2. If it is a two character Slimp then its second and last character is an 'H'.
3. If it is not a two character Slimp then it is in one of these two forms:
   * 'A' followed by 'B' followed by a Slimp followed by a 'C'.
   * 'A' followed by a Slump (see above) followed by a 'C'.
4. Nothing else is a Slimp.

A Slurpy is a character string that consists of a Slimp followed by a Slump.

Examples

* Slumps: DFG, EFG, DFFFFFG, DFDFDFDFG, DFEFFFFFG
* Not Slumps: DFEFF, EFAHG, DEFG, DG, EFFFFDG
* Slimps: AH, ABAHC, ABABAHCC, ADFGC, ADFFFFGC, ABAEFGCC, ADFDFGC
* Not Slimps: ABC, ABAH, DFGC, ABABAHC, SLIMP, ADGC
* Slurpys: AHDFG, ADFGCDFFFFFG, ABAEFGCCDFEFFFFFG
* Not Slurpys: AHDFGA, DFGAH, ABABCC

## 입력

The first line contains an integer N between 1 and 10 describing how many strings of characters are represented. The next N lines each contain a string of 1 to 60 alpha characters.

## 출력

Each of the next N lines of output should consist of either YES or NO depending on whether or not the corresponding input line is a Slurpy.
