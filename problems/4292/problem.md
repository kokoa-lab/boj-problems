## 문제

A bitstring, whose length is one less than a prime, might be magic. 1001 is one such string. In order to see the magic in the string let us append a non-bit x to it, regard the new thingy as a cyclic string, and make this square matrix of bits

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| each bit | `1001` |
| every 2nd bit | `0110` |
| every 3rd bit | `0110` |
| every 4th bit | `1001` |

This matrix has the same number of rows as the length of the original bitstring. The m-th row of the matrix has every m-th bit of the original string starting with the m-th bit. Because the enlarged thingy has prime length, the appended x never gets used.

If each row of the matrix is either the original bitstring or its complement, the original bitstring is magic.

## 입력

Each line of input (except last) contains a prime number p ≤ 100000. The last line contains 0 and this line should not be processed.

## 출력

For each prime number from the input produce one line of output containing the lexicographically smallest, non-constant magic bitstring of length p-1, if such a string exists, otherwise output Impossible.
