## 문제

We are given a directed acyclic graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Each edge has a *label* (a string of lowercase letters; possibly even an empty string). We can now extend the concept of labels from edges to paths by defining the *label of a path* as the concatenation of the labels of the edges that constitute this path (in the same order in which they appear in the path). The *smallest path* from a start vertex $s$ to a destination vertex $t$ is the path (from $s$ to $t$) whose label is lexicographically smallest (i.e. the earliest in lexicographical order) amongst all the paths from $s$ to $t$. Write a program that, for a given $s$, outputs the smallest paths from $s$ to $t$ for all vertices $t$ of the graph.

## 입력

The first line contains four space-separated integers: $n$ (the number of vertices), $m$ (the number of edges), $d$ (the length of the string $A$, on which see below) and $s$ (the number of the start vertex). The vertices are numbered by integers from 1 to $n$.

The second line contains a string $A$, which is exactly $d$ characters long; all these characters are lowercase letters of the English alphabet. All the edge labels in our graph are substrings of the string $A$.

The remaining $m$ lines describe the edges of the graph. The $i$-th of these lines describes the $i$-th edge and contains four space-separated integers: $u\_i$ (the start vertex of this edge), $v\_i$ (the end vertex of this edge), $p\_i$ and $\ell\_i$. The last two of these integers indicate that the label of this edge is the substring of $A$ that begins with the $p\_i$-th character of $A$ and is $\ell\_i$ characters long. For this purpose we consider the characters of $A$ to be indexed by integers from 1 to $d$.

## 출력

Output $n$ lines, where the $t$-th line (for $t = 1, \ldots, n$) describes the smallest path from $s$ to $t$. If there is no path from $s$ to $t$, the line should contain only the integer `0` and nothing else. Otherwise the line should start with the number of vertices on the path (including vertices $s$ and $t$), followed by the list of those vertices, separated by spaces. If there are several possible solutions, you may output any of them.

## 힌트

In this example, the edge $3 \to 1$ has the label `ab`; the edge $1 \to 4$ has the label `a`; the smallest path from $3$ to $4$ is $3 \to 1 \to 4$, whose label is `aba`.
