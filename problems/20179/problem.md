## 문제

A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more unit squares edge to edge. The figure below shows two examples of polyominos. Each of the squares contained in a polyomino is called a cell, and two cells sharing an edge are called neighbors of each other. Note that the number of neighbors of a cell can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. A polyomino *P* is called connected if every pair of cells (*a*, *b*) in *P* has a path connecting neighboring cells from *a* to *b*, and *P* is called simply connected if *P* is connected and does not contain any "hole". In the figure below, the left one is simply connected but the right one is not. We will deal with a simply connected polyomino *P* such that every cell contained in *P* has two or more neighbors.

A tiling of a polyomino *P* is a tessellation (covering using geometric shapes with no overlaps and no gaps) of *P* by translated copies of D1, D2, T1, and T2, where D1 (resp. D2) is a polyomino formed by joining two unit squares horizontally (resp. vertically), and T1 (resp. T2) is a polyomino formed by joining three unit squares horizontally (resp. vertically). The figure below shows D1, D2, T1, and T2. According to the shape of *P*, a tiling of *P* may or may not exist.

To represent a polyomino *P*, we assume that *P* is contained in an *n* × *n* unit square grid. We label each unit square *s* in the grid as 1 if *s* is a cell of *P*, or 0 otherwise. Then, the unit square grid containing *P* can be represented by an *n* × *n* matrix of 0's and 1's. A tiling of *P* can also be represented by an *n* × *n* matrix of integers as follows. If a cell of *P* is covered by a copy of D1 or D2, then we label the cell as 2 or 3, respectively. If a cell of *P* is covered by T1 or T2, then we label the cell as 4 or 5, respectively. The figure below shows an example of tiling and its representation.

Given a simply connected polyomino *P* such that every cell contained in *P* has two or more neighbors represented by an *n* × *n* matrix of 0's and 1's, write a program that outputs a tiling of *P*, if it exists.

## 입력

Your program is to read from standard input. The input starts with a line containing an integer 2 ≤ *n* ≤ 1,000, where *n* is the number of rows and columns of the unit square grid containing a polyomino *P*. Each of the following *n* lines contains *n* many 0's and 1's, and 1 denotes that the square is a cell of *P*. The polyomino *P* is simply connected and every cell contained in *P* has two or more neighbors.

## 출력

Your program is to write to standard output. If there is a tiling of *P*, print the tiling of *P* using *n* lines. Each of the *n* lines contains *n* integers from 0 to 5. A 0 represents that the square is not a cell of *P*. A 2 represents that the square is a cell of *P*, and is covered by D1. Similarly, a 3, 4, or 5 represents that the square is a cell of *P*, and is covered by D2, T1, or T2, respectively. If there is no possible tiling of *P*, then print -1.
