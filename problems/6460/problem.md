## 문제

You are responsible for ordering a large pizza for you and your friends. Each of them has told you what he wants on a pizza and what he does not; of course they all understand that since there is only going to be one pizza, no one is likely to have all their requirements satisfied. Can you order a pizza that will satisfy at least one request from all your friends?

The pizza parlor you are calling offers the following pizza toppings; you can include or omit any of them in a pizza:

| Input Code | Topping |
| --- | --- |
| A | Anchovies |
| B | Black Olives |
| C | Canadian Bacon |
| D | Diced Garlic |
| E | Extra Cheese |
| F | Fresh Broccoli |
| G | Green Peppers |
| H | Ham |
| I | Italian Sausage |
| J | Jalapeno Peppers |
| K | Kielbasa |
| L | Lean Ground Beef |
| M | Mushrooms |
| N | Nonfat Feta Cheese |
| O | Onions |
| P | Pepperoni |

Your friends provide you with a line of text that describes their pizza preferences. For example, the line

+O-H+P;

reveals that someone will accept a pizza with onion, or without ham, or with pepperoni, and the line

-E-I-D+A+J;

indicates that someone else will accept a pizza that omits extra cheese, or Italian sausage, or diced garlic, or that includes anchovies or jalapenos.

## 입력

The input consists of a series of pizza constraints.

A pizza constraint is a list of 1 to 12 topping constraint lists each on a line by itself followed by a period on a line by itself.

A topping constraint list is a series of topping requests terminated by a single semicolon.

An topping request is a sign character (+/-) and then an uppercase letter from A to P.

## 출력

For each pizza constraint, provide a description of a pizza that satisfies it. A description is the string "Toppings: " in columns 1 through 10 and then a series of letters, in alphabetical order, listing the toppings on the pizza. So, a pizza with onion, anchovies, fresh broccoli and Canadian bacon would be described by:

Toppings: ACFO

If no combination toppings can be found which satisfies at least one request of every person, your program should print the string

"No pizza can satisfy these requests." on a line by itself starting in column 1.
