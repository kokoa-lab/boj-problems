## 문제

Anders talks in the Swedish dialect of *östgötska*. Unfortunately, this makes it somewhat hard to get a programming job in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The trendy Stockholm hipsters only accept applicants speaking the standard Swedish dialect, *rikssvenska*.

To increase his chances of passing interviews, he wishes to practice talking rikssvenska. To help him with this, he wants you to write a program that can determine whenever he accidentally reverts to speaking östgötska.

A simple way of determining if a sentence is written in östgötska is if at least $40\%$ of the words in the sentence contains the letter `ä`. For simplicity, this is encoded as the letter combination `ae` (meaning any appearance of the substring \texttt{ae} is to be regarded as an occurrence of the letter `ä`).

## 입력

The first and only line of input contains a sequence of space-separated words. Each word consists only of letters `a-z`. There are at most $100$ words, and each word contains at most $15$ letters `a-z` (meaning that the `ae` combination counts as two letters for this limit).

## 출력

Output "`dae ae ju traeligt va"` if the input sentence is in östgötska, otherwise output "`haer talar vi rikssvenska`".
