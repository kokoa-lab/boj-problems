## 문제

Construct a parentheses sequence consisting of $N$ characters such that it is **balanced** and the length of its **longest palindromic subsequence (LPS)** is exactly $K$. Determine whether such a construction is possible. If there are several possible sequences, construct any of them.

A parentheses sequence consists of only character `(` and `)`. A parentheses sequence is **balanced** if each character `(` has a corresponding character `)` and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested. For example, `()`, `(())`, `(())()`, and `((())())` are balanced. However, `)(`, `(()`, and `())` are not balanced.

A sequence is **palindromic** if it reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, `((`, `)`, `())(`, and `(()((` are palindromic. However, `()`, `)(`, and `(())` are not palindromic.

A **subsequence** can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, `(`, `)))`, `())(`, and `(())()` are subsequence of `(())()`. However, `)((` and `((()))` are not subsequence of `(())()`.

The **longest palindromic subsequence (LPS)** of a sequence is a subsequence with the maximum number of characters, derived from that sequence and it is palindromic. For example, the LPS of sequence `(())()` is `())(`, which can be obtained by removing the second and sixth characters. Therefore, the length of the LPS of `(())()` is $4$.

## 입력

Input consists of two integers $N$ $K$ ($2 ≤ N ≤ 2000$; $1 ≤ K ≤ N$). $N$ is an even number.

## 출력

If there is no such parentheses sequence such that it is balanced and the length of its LPS is exactly $K$, then output `-1`.

Otherwise, output a string of $N$ characters, representing the parentheses sequence. If there are several possible answers, output any of them.
