## 문제

A class has been divided into groups of three. This division into groups might violate two types of constraints: some students must work together in the same group, and some students must work in separate groups.

Your job is to determine how many of the constraints are violated.

## 입력

The first line will contain an integer X with X ≥ 0. The next X lines will each consist of two different names, separated by a single space. These two students must be in the same group.

The next line will contain an integer Y with Y ≥ 0. The next Y lines will each consist of two different names, separated by a single space. These two students must not be in the same group.

Among these X + Y lines representing constraints, each possible pair of students appears at most once.

The next line will contain an integer G with G ≥ 1. The last G lines will each consist of three different names, separated by single spaces. These three students have been placed in the same group.

Each name will consist of between 1 and 10 uppercase letters. No two students will have the same name and each name appearing in a constraint will appear in exactly one of the G groups.

## 출력

Output an integer between 0 and X +Y which is the number of constraints that are violated.
