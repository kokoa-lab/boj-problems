## 문제

You are given an integer $N$ and a string consisting of `+` and digits. You are asked to transform the string into a valid formula whose calculation result is smaller than or equal to $N$ by modifying some characters. Here, you replace one character with another character any number of times, and the converted string should still consist of `+` and digits. Note that leading zeros and unary positive are prohibited.

For instance, `0123+456` is assumed as invalid because leading zero is prohibited. Similarly, `+1+2` and `2++3` are also invalid as they each contain a unary expression. On the other hand, `12345`, `0+1+2` and `1234+0+0` are all valid.

Your task is to find the minimum number of the replaced characters. If there is no way to make a valid formula smaller than or equal to $N$, output $-1$ instead of the number of the replaced characters.

## 입력

The input consists of a single test case in the following format.

```

$N$
$S$
```

The first line contains an integer $N$, which is the upper limit of the formula ($1 \le N \le 10^9$). The second line contains a string $S$, which consists of `+` and digits and whose length is between $1$ and $1{,}000$, inclusive. Note that it is ***not*** guaranteed that initially $S$ is a valid formula.

## 출력

Output the minimized number of the replaced characters. If there is no way to replace, output $-1$ instead.

## 힌트

In the first example, you can modify the first two characters and make a formula `1+23`, for instance. In the second example, you should make `0+10` or `10+0` by replacing all the characters. In the third example, you cannot make any valid formula less than or equal to $1$.
