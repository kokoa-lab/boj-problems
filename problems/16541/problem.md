## 문제

Two little robots are crawling along a string composed of the characters `A` and `B`. Their goal is to determine whether the string is *fine* or *coarse*.

The two robots consider a string to be *fine* if the number of `A`s and the number of `B`s in its middle third are equal. They consider all other strings to be *coarse*. For instance, the string `BBABAABBBABA` is fine because its middle third, `AABB`, contains two `A`s and two `B`s; on the contrary, the string `BAABABBBBAAB` is coarse because its middle third, `ABBB`, contains one `A` and three `B`s. The string `AABBAABB` is coarse just the same, while it does not have a middle third.

In every moment, each robot occupies one character of the string, and perceives the following things about its surroundings. It can see whether it is standing on the leftmost character, an inner character, or the rightmost character of the string (in other words, it can see whether there are any more characters on the left and right). It can see whether it is alone at its position, or the other robot occupies the same position together with it. Lastly, it can see what character it is standing on, `A` or `B`.

Apart from that, each robot is capable of retaining memories about its travels. Unfortunately, the memory of each robot spans just four bits.

There is a “list of instructions” in every robot’s head, and the two lists may differ widely.

Each instruction consists of three parts:

Left side (*condition*)->(*special characters*)Right side (*instruction for action*)

The left side includes:

* One character indicating whether the robot is at one of the string’s ends: `L` for “If it is at the **L**eftmost character”, `I` for “If it is at an **I**nner character”, or `R` for “If it is at the **R**ightmost character”
* One character, `O` for “if there is **O**ne robot at this position” or `T` for “if there are **T**wo robots at this position”, indicating whether the robot is alone, or the other robot occupies the same position together with it
* The character that the robot is standing on, `A` for “if it is on **A**”, or `B` for “if it is on **B**”
* 4 characters, each `0` or `1`, describing the contents of the robot’s memory, e.g., `0101` for “if the memory contains `0101`”

In this way, the left side forms a condition, which is a conjunction of these *simple conditions*, and has a value of “true” or “false”, depending on the current position of the robot, and the history, stored in its four bits of memory.

The right side appears as follows:

* One character indicating what action the robot is to take: `L` for “Move one step **L**eft”, `R` for “Move one step **R**ight”, `S` for “**S**tay in place”, `Y` for “Report that **Y**es, the string is fine”, or `N` for “Report that **N**o, the string is coarse”
* Except of the cases when the work is done (actions `Y` or `N`) – four more characters, each `0` or `1`, indicating the revised contents of the robot’s memory, e.g., `0110`.

Any character in an instruction line apart from the two special characters and the action character may be replaced with the wildcard `?`.

When the wildcard character `?` occurs in the left side of the instruction (condition) it means that the corresponding simple condition is not checked.

When the wildcard character `?` occurs in the memory overwrite part of an instruction line (i.e. after the action character), it indicates that the corresponding bits of the robot’s memory are to be left unchanged.

For instance, the instruction line

`LT???01->R??10`

tells: “If the robot occupies the leftmost character of the string, the other robot occupies the same position together with it, and the last two bits of its memory are set to `0` and `1`, then (no matter whether it is standing on an `A` or a `B`) it is to move one step right and flip the last two bits of its memory to `1` and `0`, without changing the first two bits”.

Both robots start their journey on the leftmost character of the string. Initially, all bits in each robot’s memory are set to `0`.

Every millisecond, each robot looks around, searches its memory, consults its list for guidance, and decides to either move one step left, move one step right, stay in place, or voice its opinion about the string. Additionally, the robot may commit any impressions or intentions to memory. As soon as any robot voices an opinion about the string, their task is done and they switch off. If both robots happen to say their opinion about the string, the opinion of the first is valid.

In detail, each robot checks consecutively the instruction list for an ***exact accordance*** of its current state with the left part of an instruction. When it ***first*** meets one, it executes the instruction found. Otherwise, the robot restarts the search from the beginning of list, and executes the ***first*** instruction containing a wildcard, which corresponds to its position and memory contents. If there is no match again, the robots switch off without recognizing the kind of the string (and their task remains unsolved).

You have to create two instruction lists, one for each robot, such that they will always correctly determine whether a given string of length ***at least two characters***, composed of the letters `A` and `B`, is fine or coarse.

This is an **output only** problem. You have to create and submit a single text file robots.txt containing (in this order):

* One line reading Robot 1
* Several instruction lines making up the first robot’s instruction list (one instruction in a line)
* One line reading Robot 2
* Several instruction lines making up the second robot’s instruction list (one instruction in a line).

The file robots.txt may contain comment lines, which are simply skipped by the robot. Such lines start with the character `%` (percent).
